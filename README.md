Vorkurs: Python OOP

This course is for beginners. It is an introduction to object oriented programming in general with examples in python.

It consists of a presentation, which covers OOP basics and biological background needed for later tool development. 

The code\_chunks and the python\_oop.ipynb introduce the same python snippets with OOP basics (depending on the format (terminal, IDE, notebook) either/or can be used).

The basics will be covered with the students by going over the chunks together and try to solve some basic exercises "Exercise.txt" in between. Solutions can be found in the solution directory. 

The last step is to design a simple DecoyGenerator tool, which is able to generate decoys by reversing the sequence for proteins and rna. Which is flexible enough add addition sequence types, such as modified RNA or DNA sequences. One possible solution can be found in the DecoyGenerator.py.
